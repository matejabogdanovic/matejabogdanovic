### 💻 **C++ - 👉 <a href="https://github.com/matejabogdanovic/SS-Assembler-Linker-Emulator">Assembler, Linker & Emulator</a>**

📅 **Year:** 2025\
A single project implementing a **complete toolchain**:

- **Assembler:** Single-pass assembler converting assembly code into textual or binary object files
- **Linker:** Target-independent linker combining multiple assembler outputs, resolving symbols, and generating relocatable or memory initialization files
- **Emulator:** Interpretive emulator executing programs from memory initialization files, emulating CPU registers and terminal I/O until the `halt` instruction

### ⚙️ **C - 👉 <a href="https://github.com/matejabogdanovic/AOR2-KVM-Virtual-Machine">Mini Hypervisor Project</a>**

📅 **Year:** 2025\
A low-level systems project implementing a simplified **hypervisor** using the **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)** API in C.

- **Purpose:** Run guest virtual machines (VMs) in 64-bit long mode with configurable memory and page size
- **Version A:** Single VM execution with serial I/O and `hlt` termination handling
- **Version B:** Concurrent multi-VM support using POSIX threads
- **Version C:** Guest file I/O operations via I/O ports (open, read, write, close)
- **Focus:** Memory management, virtualization, and I/O emulation at kernel level

### 📂 **C++ - 👉 <a href="https://github.com/matejabogdanovic/FAT-File-System-Simulation">FAT File System Implemented on a .txt File</a>**

📅 **Year:** 2025\
A simple **FAT file system** implemented using a plain text file, encapsulated in a class that simulates a disk. Hard disk class supports basic **read** and **write** operations to specific disk blocks, mimicking real disk interface.

### 🔧 **C/C++/ASM - 👉 <a href="https://github.com/matejabogdanovic/University/tree/main/Year2/Semester4/OS1/riscv-simple-kernel">Simple Risc-V Kernel</a>**
